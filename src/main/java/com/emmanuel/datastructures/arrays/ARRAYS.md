# Arrays ðŸ“š

## Definition:
> ***An array is a type of data structure that stores a collection of values
of the same data type in a fixed-size capacity.
There are mostly two types of arrays which are static and dynamic arrays.***

## Static Array
> ***A static array is a fixed length size of capacity that contains a number of values
that are accessible via indexable range typically from 0 to n-1.
Static array elements are stored as contiguous pieces of memory; all the address in the memory are adjacent.***

### Complexity
- Access: O(1)
- Search: 0(n)

## Dynamic Array
> ***A dynamic array is a static array that is flexible with resizing.
A dynamic array allows adding, removing, and increasing its size.
Whereas static array does not have these properties.***

### Complexity
- Access: 0(1)
- Search: 0(n)
- Insert: 0(n)
- Append: 0(n)
- Delete: 0(n)
